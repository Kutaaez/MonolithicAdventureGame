# SolidAdventureGame
This project is a simple game refactored using SOLID principles. The goal is to break a big, messy game into small, smart parts. Now, enemies, items, and players all have their own jobsâ€”just like in real life! It helps to understand OOP better and makes adding new features easier. No more spaghetti code, just clean and solid (pun intended) structure!
